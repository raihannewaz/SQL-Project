##Database creation:
The script first checks if a database named "E_CommerceDB" already exists in the system and drops it if it does.
Then, a new database named "E_CommerceDB" is created with specific file locations and sizes for the data and log files.

##Schema creation:
The script creates a schema named "ec" within the "E_CommerceDB" database.

##Table creation:
The script creates several tables within the "ec" schema, including:
"Supplier" table with columns SupplierID, SupplierName, Phone, Address, and Email.
"Product" table with columns ProductID, ProductName, and Color.
"Category" table with columns CategoryID and CategoryName.
"ProductInfo" table with columns PurInfoID, SupplierID, CategoryID, ProductID, Quantity, and UnitPrice.
"Stock" table with columns StockID, ProdCode, StockName, PurInfoID, and AvailQuantity.
"Customer" table with columns CustomerID, CustomerName, Phone, Address, and Email.
"Orders" table with columns OrdersID, OrderDate, and CustomerID.
"OrderDetails" table with columns OrderDetID, OrdersID, ProdCode, Quantity, UnitPrice, and Discount.

##More

It also demonstrates various SQL concepts and operations such as joins, subqueries, wildcards, aggregate functions, grouping sets, sequence, CTE, CASE expression, operators, and more.
